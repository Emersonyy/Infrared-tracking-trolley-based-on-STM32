# Infrared-tracking-trolley-based-on-STM32
The infrared tracking trolley based on the STM32 chip identifies the black path through the probe and follows it to meet the corresponding conditions
The software part is written with KEIL5, and ST-Link is used as the download cable to connect the board to the computer. In the writing of the program, in line with the principle of clarity and conciseness, the encapsulation format of the main library function is adopted. The library function is configured with the GPIO interface (including the motor part, infrared tracking, obstacle avoidance part, PWM speed regulation part, a total of 11 pins), TIM timer, and 6 different motion state settings of the trolley, including straight line, backward, left turn, right turn, right turn, fast left turn, and different motor speeds are set for different motion states in order to meet the needs of different modules. In the main function, the Switch Case statement is used to write a total of 11 judgment conditions, which are combined with each other to complete a total of 11 module tasks.
